# DIY Identity Governance

Code and documents for the presentation for DIY Identity Governance: Building a Modern IGA Program with a Small Team, a presentation submission for Identiverse 2026. Created by Andrew Bowen and Damien Bolin.

## Presentation Abstract

Deploying a modern and functional IAM system is often associated with massive organizational change requiring 3rd party assessments, vendor-heavy implementations, and some divine intervention. But it doesn’t have to be. This session tells the story of how our small, yet focused team built and deployed an organization wide IAM system with some creative problem-solving and a DIY mindset utilizing Microsoft Identity Governance.

We’ll walk through our system design, business alignment, and some of the technical decisions that led to a successful deployment. Then we’ll cover the hands-on technical implementation with a deep dive into the key solutions which allowed us to overcome challenges and add some enterprise grade features to tie everything together.

Attendees will also get access to our GitHub repository containing homegrown scripts to run in your environment which will assist with RBAC evaluation in an AD/Entra environment and others which will help automate deployments of Microsoft’s IGA components.

While IAM initiatives are often associated with large budgets and armies of consultants, this session shows how a small internal team can deliver effective, scalable identity governance through thoughtful design, modest investment, and creative DIY solutions.

### Damien Bolin, Senior Information Security Engineer

### Andrew Bowen, Information Security Analyst

I am an Information Security Analyst at the Waldinger Corporation and a part of the IAM team. I joined two years ago after graduating from Iowa State University as a Cybersecurity Engineer. My role involves designing and implementing IAM architecture as well as cloud security and endpoint management. My expertise involves infrastructure as code, role-based access control and identity lifecycle management, including custom automations. I enjoy designing new solutions while looking for ways to automate and streamline management, especially for non-technical team members.
